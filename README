GridSpice Installation

One can register as either root or user.

To register as:

A) Root:
    1) Run root_install.py, providing the following three arguments:
        a. AWS Access Key
        b. AWS Secret Key
        c. A name to use as a key-pair. (If the key-pair does not
           exist, the script will automatically generate the key-pair.)

    2) You now have root access to your own GridSpice server, using the
       key-pair that you specified earlier.

    3) You are given a Master API Key, which can be used to access any 
       account on your server through the GridSpice Python API.

B) User:
    1) Run user_install.py, providing the following argument:
        a. URL on which your account is being hosted.  

    2) You now have access to your account on that server, using the 
       API key given to you by your host provider.  

Thank you for using GridSpice!
