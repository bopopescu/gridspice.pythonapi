Getting Started
================
GridSpice provides a documented REST API which allows users to programmatically perform many operations such as
 
* Importing, Creating, and Modifying models
* Running iterative, simulataneous simulations on the GridSpice cluster
* Collecting results in a structured format for easy post-processing 
 
.. note::
    This library is still 'experimental'.
 
The python library makes it simple to begin working:
 
>>> import gridspice
>>> myAccount = gridspice.account.login( 'akuw5nceip9rdrejoiuj74ko9842qxbmi63sfgvbxswhfkoujiyfwrt6434y8k' )
>>> myProjects = myAccount.showProjects()
>>> for project in myProjects:
...    	print project.name()
